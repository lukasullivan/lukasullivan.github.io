<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season.
