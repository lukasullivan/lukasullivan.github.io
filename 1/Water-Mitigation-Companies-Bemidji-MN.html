<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
