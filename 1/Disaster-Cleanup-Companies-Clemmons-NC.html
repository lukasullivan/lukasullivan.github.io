<h3>Why You Should Hire Clemmons Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this assists enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
