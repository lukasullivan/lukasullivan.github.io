Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>
