<h2>Steps to Preventing Water Damage in Inman</h2>

<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
