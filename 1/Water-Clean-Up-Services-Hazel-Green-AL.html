<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
