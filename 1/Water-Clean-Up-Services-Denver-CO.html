<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
