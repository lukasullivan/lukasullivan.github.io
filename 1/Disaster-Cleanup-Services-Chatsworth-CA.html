<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going person.</p>
