<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Salida</h3>
<p>These are generally excellent indications of mold, potentially unsafe and certainly something you want to remove. The scientific name for the greenish-black mold that shows up on carpet, ceiling, and wallpaper tiles is Stachybotrys Chartarum or Black Mold.

If there is a great deal of mold development, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ". Printable versions of these and other guidance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty product is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement might be necessary.<p>
