<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a large brush, and remember that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall might need to be eliminated and changed. If basement carpet has actually become moldy, sweep it (while wearing a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or utilize high-powered fans to eliminate moisture if it's affixed to the floor.</p>
