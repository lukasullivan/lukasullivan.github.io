Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
