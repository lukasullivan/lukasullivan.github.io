Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.
