<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air movement across damp surfaces of assemblies or products is a crucial part of efficiently and effectively drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies. Fast air motion across the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface moisture gives way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation products. The constant and falling rates of drying products require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
