<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a wet towel. Similar to a few of the above methods, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The biggest step in the procedure is restoration. Restoration includes changing products like drywall and insulation. In some cases this procedure is as simple as setting up a couple of panels of drywall, while severe cases might need changing whole walls. Exposure to toxic substances like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older houses are likely to consist of these compounds.</p>

<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Damascus</h3>
<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Reaction online, and they were out within the hour. It was a severe experience, however everything they provided for me was great. They best aspect of First Response was that they had the ability to manage my insurance company when they were offering me issues. This probably helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the concern for me, which was a substantial relief. They were really professional, and I liked everybody I handled from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were handled to my satisfaction. I would utilize them once again.<p>
