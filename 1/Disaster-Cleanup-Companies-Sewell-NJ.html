When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
