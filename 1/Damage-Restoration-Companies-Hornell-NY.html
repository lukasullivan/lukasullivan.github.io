<p>It's a difficult scenario when water floods your floorings, soaks into your walls, and damages your furniture.

Place water-permeable packages of desiccants and damp items in airtight containers or in sealed areas, like closets. Some desiccants alter color to suggest they are filled, which can take days or weeks, depending on just how much wetness products consist of.<p>
