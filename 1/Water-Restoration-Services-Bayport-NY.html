<p>Since typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
