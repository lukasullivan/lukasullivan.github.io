<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out how much water expense I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>
