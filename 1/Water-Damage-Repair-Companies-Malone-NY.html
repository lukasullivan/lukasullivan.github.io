As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets.

These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days.
