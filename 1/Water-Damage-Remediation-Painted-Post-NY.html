<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
