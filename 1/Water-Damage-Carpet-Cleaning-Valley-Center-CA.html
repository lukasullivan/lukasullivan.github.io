Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
