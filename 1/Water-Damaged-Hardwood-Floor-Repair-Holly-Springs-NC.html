Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself.

As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets.
