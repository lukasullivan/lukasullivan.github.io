<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (often two times a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and also were really handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
