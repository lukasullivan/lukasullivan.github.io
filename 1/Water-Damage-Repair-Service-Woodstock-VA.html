They can cause illness, trigger allergies, and continue to damage products long after the flood.</p>

You can also seal the door gaps to avoid any particles from spreading to the other space. Prepare your bleach, brushes, rags, gloves, disinfectants and everything you require for the cleaning process.</p>
