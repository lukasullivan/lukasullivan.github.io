They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.
