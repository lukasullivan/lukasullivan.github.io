<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore security, and cover hands, legs and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will decrease the occurrence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair shops, to disinfect the moldy locations, in addition to any surrounding areas. If you use bleach, make certain it won't tarnish the material or surface area. Place all sponges, devices and other materials used in cleaning in a strong trash can, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a neighboring exit as opposed to the primary house, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings must be included in the drying record to include devices, air, and heating and cooling systems.
