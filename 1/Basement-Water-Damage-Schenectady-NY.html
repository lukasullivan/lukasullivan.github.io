<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. There is a great video below that I encourage you to enjoy.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying given that the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.</p>
