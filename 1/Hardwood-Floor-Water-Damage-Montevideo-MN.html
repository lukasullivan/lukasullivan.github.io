<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can take place by itself if a fire is contained. After the standing water has actually been eliminated and products that could posture a drying or structural threat have actually been eliminated, the drying process will start. This often involves putting fans and a dehumidifier in the area. In many cases, it may likewise include setting up plastic sheeting and using heaters so that the water can evaporate.

<p>As the job progresses and the environment is stabilized, materials can be dried by managing the airflow, energy, and humidity (heat). Further into the drying, air motion must be re-directed and make sure great transfer of energy to the staying wet locations. The total requirement for humidity control and airflow can be lower than at the start of the project since there is considerably less wetness in materials being vaporized during the latter stage.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air.
