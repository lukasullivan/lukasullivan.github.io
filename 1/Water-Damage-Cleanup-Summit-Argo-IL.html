<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>The most crucial aspect of treating drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew occur most regularly. Regardless of the location or extent of the damage, we advise using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or similar devices that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard household fans are not capable of moving a sufficient amount of air required to dry a space properly.</p>
