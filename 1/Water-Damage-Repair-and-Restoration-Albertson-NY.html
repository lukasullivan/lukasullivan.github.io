<p>Any building that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on walls and floors is another possible result of water damage. Walls and flooring might need replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage.

Standard family fans are not capable of moving an appropriate quantity of air needed to dry a space properly.</p>
