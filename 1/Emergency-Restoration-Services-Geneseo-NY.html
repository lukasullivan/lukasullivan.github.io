<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
