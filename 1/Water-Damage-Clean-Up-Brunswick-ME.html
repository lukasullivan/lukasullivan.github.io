<h3>Why You Should Hire Brunswick Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Inspect the drywall to see just how much damage has been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or fall apart to the touch. Get rid of all compromised drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to remove it. If drywall panels just reveal water discolorations but aren't structurally jeopardized, they might be repairable by cutting out the damaged part. When eliminating around the damaged location, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
<p>If you do choose to employ us to repair the water damage, we will do everything in our power get your home back to typical as rapidly as possible by fixing the damageas if it was our own home and our own household was displaced.
