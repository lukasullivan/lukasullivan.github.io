<p>You want to address restroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
