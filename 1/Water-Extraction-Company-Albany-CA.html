But in the short-term, here are some natural home solutions (made with things you likely currently have on-hand) that will help get rid of mold.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a big brush, and keep in mind that permeable surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall may require to be eliminated and changed.
