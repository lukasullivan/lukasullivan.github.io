It was an extreme experience, however whatever they did for me was fantastic. When they were offering me problems, they finest thing about First Response was that they were able to handle my insurance company. This probably helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and managed the issue for me, which was a huge relief. They were very expert, and I liked everyone I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were handled to my complete satisfaction. I would utilize them again.<p>

<p>In advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: significant leak or glowing floor heating leak), fixing the subfloor may even be necessary. For best results, refinish the entire space, as trying to repair a little area will show up for several years, offering an obvious sign that the floor has actually had some form of damage.

It is challenging to state whether this damage is going to be irreversible or if it will lead to other issues, so the very best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
<p>Work from the floor to the ceiling to avoid streaking if walls have already dried. (Filthy water sprinkled on dry walls might be taken in and ended up being nearly impossible to get rid of.)
