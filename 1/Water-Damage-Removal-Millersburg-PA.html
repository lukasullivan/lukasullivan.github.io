<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. Juice three to five lemons and put over afflicted location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a damp towel. Just like a few of the above methods, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
