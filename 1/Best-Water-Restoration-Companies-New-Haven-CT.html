Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful person.</p>
