Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very costly paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
