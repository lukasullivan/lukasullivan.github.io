Never utilize soot cleaner or water prior to you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas underneath. Or simply grab a brand-new sponge. Ensure you use a wiping movement the whole time.
