<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Action online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, however everything they did for me was fantastic. When they were offering me problems, they best thing about First Reaction was that they were able to handle my insurance company. This most likely helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the issue for me, which was a big relief. They were very expert, and I liked everybody I handled from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were handled to my fulfillment. I would utilize them once again.<p>
