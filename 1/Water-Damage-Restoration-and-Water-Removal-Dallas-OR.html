<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is great and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
