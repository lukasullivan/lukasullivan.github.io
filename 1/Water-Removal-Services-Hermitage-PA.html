<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and split chimney can typically allow rain throughout the colder months which can seep through the walls. Over time, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to peel, flake and bubble. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into an unloved and tired  area.<p>
<p>The time it considers the mold removal procedure depends on many elements such as how much mold exists, where the mold is growing (behind walls, and so on), and the products it grows on.

<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
