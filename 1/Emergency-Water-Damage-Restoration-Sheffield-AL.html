Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being fully replaced.

However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might require changing and in some cases even the subfloor too. The type of wood floor covering you might have identifies and restricts the type of repairs that need to take place. Solid hardwood flooring permits a larger variety of choices to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This kind of flooring can likewise have replacements for private slabs. The best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
