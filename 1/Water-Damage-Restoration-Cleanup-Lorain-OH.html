<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth.

There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which don't produce hazardous fumes or leave behind poisonous residue. For these factors try to avoid using bleach and if you need to use it, just use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
