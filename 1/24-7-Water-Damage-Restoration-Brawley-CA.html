<h3>Fire Damage Remediation in Brawley</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and need to be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
