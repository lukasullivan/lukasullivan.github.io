<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are fantastic for drying in difficult to reach areas-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are preferable when drying under carpet and padding. Much like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout damp surfaces, evaporating wetness into the air. With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments if you have concerns on this.</p>
