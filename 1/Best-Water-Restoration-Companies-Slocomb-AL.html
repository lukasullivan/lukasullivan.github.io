<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Slocomb</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health risk and need to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
