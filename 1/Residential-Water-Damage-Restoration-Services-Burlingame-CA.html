<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his men were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (often two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the method and also were very practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
