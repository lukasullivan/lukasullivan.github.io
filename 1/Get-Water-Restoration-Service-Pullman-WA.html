<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper).

<p>Mold can be found nearly anywhere you turn. They grow on practically any organic compound as long as wetness and oxygen exist. Mold can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation.
