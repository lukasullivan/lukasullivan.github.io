<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
