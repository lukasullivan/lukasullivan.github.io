Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season.
