<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the steady and slow deterioration of materials (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust takes place when you combine electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no dependable schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal components generally begin wearing away immediately after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of a problem. How quickly the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration caused by a water spill.</p>
