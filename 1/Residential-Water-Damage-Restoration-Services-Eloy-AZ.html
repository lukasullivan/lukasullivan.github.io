<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Eloy</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repair work, remember that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is completed.<p>
