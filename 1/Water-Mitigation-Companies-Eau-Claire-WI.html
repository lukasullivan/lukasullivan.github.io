<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely destructive. We engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was produced. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized specialist on the biological elements of air pollution, this group was appointed to validate and test the new technology.

Together, we had the ability to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for business clients that, unlike any other technique or device, can provide scientifically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so instantly. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
