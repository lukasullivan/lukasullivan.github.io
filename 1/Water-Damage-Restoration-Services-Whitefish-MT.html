<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then wipe it away with a damp towel. Similar to some of the above techniques, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you seem like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most regularly when wet drywall sits with inadequate ventilation. Regardless of the location or extent of the damage, we recommend using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or similar machines that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Basic family fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient amount of air needed to dry a room sufficiently.</p>

<p>If smoke and fire damage has affected your personal belongings, we will work with you and your insurer to identify what can be restored, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged possessions. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into permeable surface, preventing water from permeating back through. Basically, it makes the location strong again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have applied the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>
