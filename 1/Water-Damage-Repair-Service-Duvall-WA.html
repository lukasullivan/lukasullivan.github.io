<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
