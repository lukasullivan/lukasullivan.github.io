<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Kinder</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and need to be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
