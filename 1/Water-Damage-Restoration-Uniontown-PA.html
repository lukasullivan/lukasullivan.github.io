Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being fully changed. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require repairing, if there is minor damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might need replacing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The kind of wood floor covering you might have figures out and restricts the type of repairs that need to happen. Solid hardwood flooring allows for a larger range of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This type of floor covering can likewise have replacements for specific planks. The very best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
