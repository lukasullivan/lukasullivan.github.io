<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Even when you include a small indoor fire, smoke damage can happen. That's since fire is a noticeable combustion of light and heat energy, and most people know how to consist of a fire. For that reason, people will work to include a fire without focusing on smoke damage avoidance. Smoke is somewhat harder to see than the fire itself and seems less threatening. Likewise, due to the fact that it's in the air, it's almost difficult to contain. Even after a fire is dispatched, smoke in the air can cause damage. Smoke damage restoration services are often required to bring back damage left from small indoor fires.</p>
