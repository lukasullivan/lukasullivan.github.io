<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most terrible things that can take place to an individual or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed rather than being fully replaced. If there is minor damage then the majority of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard may require repairing. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the whole floor may require replacing and in some cases even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood flooring you may have determines and limits the type of repair work that need to take place. Solid hardwood flooring permits a broader range of choices to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual planks. The best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
