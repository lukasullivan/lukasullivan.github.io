To restrict damage to individual belongings, remove any items that can be moved.

It, like many kinds of mold, grows at a worrying rate in the right conditions-- specifically in places with extended direct exposure to moisture and humidity, such as basements, bathrooms, under-sink cabinets, or recently flooded locations.
