<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health danger and should be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
