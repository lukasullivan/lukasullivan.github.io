<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors.

While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
