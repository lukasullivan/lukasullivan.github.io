<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
