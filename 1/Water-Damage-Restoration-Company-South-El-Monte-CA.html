<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>Damaged locations bigger than 12 square inches may require a complete replacement panel installed since large pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists.

If not, you might have to change the entire drywall panel.</p>
