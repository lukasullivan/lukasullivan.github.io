<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Because mold and mildew can be a major health threat, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
