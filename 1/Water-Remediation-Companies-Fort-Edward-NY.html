<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job appropriately.
