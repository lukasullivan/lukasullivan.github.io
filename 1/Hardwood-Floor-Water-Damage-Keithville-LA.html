They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done effectively.
