<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a serious health threat. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches may require a total replacement panel set up since large pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists.

For instance, if the area where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to protect a spot by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might need to replace the whole drywall panel.</p>
