<p>As wetness is launched in the air, nature always tries to reach stability. Calculating the dew point is important in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point constantly takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The greater the dew point increases, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>

<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth learning.
