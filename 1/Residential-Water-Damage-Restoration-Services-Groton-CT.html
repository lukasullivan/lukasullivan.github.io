<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most terrible things that can happen to a household or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being completely replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may need repairing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor may need replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The sort of wood floor covering you may have figures out and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Solid hardwood flooring allows for a wider range of choices to fix the problem.
