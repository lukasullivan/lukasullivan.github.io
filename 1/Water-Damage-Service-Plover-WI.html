<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The most significant action in the process is restoration. Restoration involves replacing materials like drywall and insulation. Often this procedure is as easy as installing a few panels of drywall, while serious cases could require changing whole walls. Direct exposure to toxic compounds like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older houses are most likely to contain these substances.</p>
