<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
