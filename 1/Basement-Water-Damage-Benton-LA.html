<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were incredible in assisting us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

Using bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Professional Mold Remediation.
