Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
