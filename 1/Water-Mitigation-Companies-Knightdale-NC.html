<p>Because typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
