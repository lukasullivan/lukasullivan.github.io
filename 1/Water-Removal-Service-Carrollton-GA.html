<p>Smoke damage is a common negative effects of fire damage, however it can occur on its own if a fire is contained. If it is the outcome of water damage related to a common hazard, when home insurance covers mold. If situations such as burst pipelines or an A/C system overflow permit mold to grow, your property owner's insurance will cover all or some of the mold removal expense due to the fact that the mold is considered an extension of water damage."

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged.

Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
