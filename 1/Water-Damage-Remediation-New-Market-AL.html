<p>To get moisture out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many individuals swear by uncooked rice, advising owners to put their damp iPad or iPhone in a big bowl of the stuff (cover it completely) and leave it there for two days or two. A: Mold is a microscopic fungi that belongs to the natural environment and necessary for our community.
