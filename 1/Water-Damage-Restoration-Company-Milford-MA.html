<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
