They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job effectively.
