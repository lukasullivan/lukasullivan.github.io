<p>Mold - the look, the smell, even the thought of it makes you recoil. You most likely have visions of long-forgotten takeout food packed in the back of your fridge, or an old decrepit bathtub that hasn't been utilized in years. However aside from what may be growing in your refrigerator, household mold is really really typical, and can represent a significant health risk if left unchecked. After eliminating all polluted and damp materials, contact someone who can examine your home and start the restoration process.<p>
<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead natural material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also obtain nutrients from some artificial items such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs wetness, although some mold types can get that wetness from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards away from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The permeable product can rapidly absorb flood water, and you need to know the degree of prospective damage.<p>
