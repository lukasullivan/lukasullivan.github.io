Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>
