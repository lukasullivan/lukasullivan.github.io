<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of residential or commercial property damage that a household or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really costly paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>
