<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Now that you can determine when water damage is covered by your homeowner's insurance, it's vital that you to call your insurance provider as quickly as possible once you discover water damage in your home.

<p>Because common building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
