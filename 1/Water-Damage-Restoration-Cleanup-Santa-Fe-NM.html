<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach balance. Computing the humidity is essential in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid type. The higher the dew point increases, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
