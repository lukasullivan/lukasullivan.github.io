<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins.

When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
