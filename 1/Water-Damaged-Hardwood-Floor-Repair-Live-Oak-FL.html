<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
