<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. When blended with ammonia, chlorine bleach also gives off extreme fumes and it even produces hazardous gas. There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce dangerous fumes or leave behind harmful residue. For these reasons try to avoid utilizing bleach and if you need to utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
