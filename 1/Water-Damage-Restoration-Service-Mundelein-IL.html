<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>But you might not have the ability to get insurance to pay for your mold remediation costs if the damage is a result of your overlook-- for example, if you've had a slow leak under your bathroom sink for many years and have actually disregarded the problem. If the insurer can figure out that the mold damage is a result of your neglect, they likely won't cover mold remediation costs. If you do not have flood insurance coverage, your house owner's insurance coverage likely will not cover the loss. If the flood has been stated a federal disaster by the President, get assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>
<p>Water damage can lead to mold growth within 48 hours and require even more financial investment to repair if you do not respond rapidly. We will then get rid of the contents of the room or space to an unaffected area, being particularly cautious not to cross-contaminate. If furniture, design, or other contents have actually been damaged by the leakage, our content restoration experts can load out your items for cleaning and sterilizing at our center.<p>
