<p>Because typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
