<p>Drywall is really a panel of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched between two kinds of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was first became available in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Gypsum Corporation put out a product called Sheetrock" suggested to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering.
