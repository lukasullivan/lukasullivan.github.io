Testing firms must not provide any information on how to handle the problem, or charge you for remediation; they must only evaluate the mold and tell you what it is.<p>

We can help restore the environment in your home and supply irreversible treatments that keep mold growth at bay. Set an old box fan or an inexpensive new one in a window to aerate the space while working. Throw it out when you're done cleaning, because the spores are nearly impossible to clean off. Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>
