<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach likewise releases extreme fumes and it even produces toxic gas when mixed with ammonia. There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce unsafe fumes or leave hazardous residue. For these reasons try to avoid using bleach and if you must utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
