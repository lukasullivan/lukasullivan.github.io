<p>Recent Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>But you may not be able to get insurance to spend for your mold remediation costs if the damage is an outcome of your neglect-- for instance, if you've had a sluggish leak under your bathroom sink for years and have actually ignored the problem. If the insurer can determine that the mold damage is a result of your negligence, they likely won't cover mold remediation expenses. If you do not have flood insurance, your house owner's insurance likely will not cover the loss. If the flood has actually been stated a federal disaster by the President, obtain assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>
<p>Correct Use of Containment - In our experience for many years, we have found that mold will localize in areas of high moisture, dark surroundings, and low ventilation. Thankfully, we can contain the affected locations to keep mold spores from spreading to other areas of the residential or commercial property and causing cross contamination.
