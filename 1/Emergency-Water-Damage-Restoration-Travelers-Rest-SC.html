Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
