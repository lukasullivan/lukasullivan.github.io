Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season.
