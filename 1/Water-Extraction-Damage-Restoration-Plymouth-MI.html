<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As discussed, fast air movement throughout wet surface areas of products or assemblies is a critical part of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Fast air motion throughout the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface moisture gives way to minimizing moisture content in low evaporation products. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require various requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature constantly attempts to reach equilibrium. Calculating the humidity is important in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point always takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas kind. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the dew point increases, the greater the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
