<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have ended up being polluted with molds.

When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
