<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a household or company can experience.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>
