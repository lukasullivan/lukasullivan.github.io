Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying because the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Very courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
