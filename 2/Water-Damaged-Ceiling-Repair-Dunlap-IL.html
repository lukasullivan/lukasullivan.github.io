For that reason, people will work to contain a fire without prioritizing smoke damage prevention. Smoke is slightly harder to see than the fire itself and appears less threatening.

<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health threat and should be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
