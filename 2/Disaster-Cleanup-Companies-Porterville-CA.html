<p>If you're actually confident about doing DIY repair work on your iPhone, the very best technique to a damp iPhone is to loosen the bottom screws (on many designs of iPhone this will require a proprietary type of screwdriver head, offered as part of some iPhone repair sets offered by unofficial third-party accessory makers) and gain access to the interior. Use the cloth on the musty location to get rid of the mold with the baking soda and water option.<p>
<p>Furthermore, although ammonia can eliminate surface mold, dead mold and dead mold spores are still allergenic so you will need to make certain to remove them afterwards.

So you're taking a look at two unattractive options: power down (but at the same time trigger the screen and operating system to awaken briefly before turning off) or leave the device in sleep mode and hope you do not get any notices.<p>
