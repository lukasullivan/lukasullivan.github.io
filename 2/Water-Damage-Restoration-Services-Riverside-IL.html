The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or methods will be the most reliable. It is crucial to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple building materials and how they respond to each one and provide the very best evaporation results. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
