<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or techniques will be the most reliable. It is vital to determine if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and reasonable energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly predicts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they react to each one and offer the very best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
