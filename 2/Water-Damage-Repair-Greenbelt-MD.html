<h3>Fire Damage Remediation in Greenbelt</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and should be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
