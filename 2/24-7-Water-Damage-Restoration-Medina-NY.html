<h3>Why You Should Hire Medina Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By decreasing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is finished.<p>
