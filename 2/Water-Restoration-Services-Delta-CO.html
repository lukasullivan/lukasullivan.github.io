<p>Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health risk and should be removed if soaked by infected floodwater.

This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
