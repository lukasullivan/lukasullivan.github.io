<p>As moisture is launched in the air, nature constantly tries to reach equilibrium. Determining the humidity is very important in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas kind. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid form if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the dew point rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and gradual wear and tear of materials (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you integrate electricity, oxygen, water and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no reliable timetable for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal parts generally start corroding right away after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of an issue. How quickly the rust process takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
