<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over afflicted area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a damp towel. Similar to some of the above approaches, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are utilized on any difficult surfaces to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be eliminated, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are typically brought offsite for cleaning to make sure all mold spores are eliminated, typically involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
