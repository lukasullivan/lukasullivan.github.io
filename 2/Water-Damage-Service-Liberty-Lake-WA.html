<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying because the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going person.</p>
