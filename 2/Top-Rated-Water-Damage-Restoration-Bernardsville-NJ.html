<h3>Dealing With Fire Damage Properly in Bernardsville</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and must be gotten rid of.

This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
