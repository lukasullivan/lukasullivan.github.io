<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or techniques will be the most effective. It is essential to identify if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and practical energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to several building products and how they respond to each one and offer the very best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the quicker products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings must be included in the drying record to consist of equipment, air, and a/c systems.

It is essential to know that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if modifications are needed.</p>
