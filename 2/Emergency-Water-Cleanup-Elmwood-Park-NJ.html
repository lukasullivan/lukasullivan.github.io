<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration Companies in Elmwood Park</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repair work, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
