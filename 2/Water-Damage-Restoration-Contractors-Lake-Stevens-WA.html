To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush till the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off since borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water quickly.
