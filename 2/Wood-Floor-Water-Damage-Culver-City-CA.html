<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air motion across damp surface areas of materials or assemblies is a critical part of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface vary from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air motion across the surface of product becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface wetness gives way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need different requirements for altering conditions.</p>

<p>Use a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, due to the fact that it might accidentally press liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. If the phone was totally submerged, you may try vacuuming around the phone's openings and fractures to draw more water out. As soon as the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is crucial to avoid recontamination. You should seal and instantly get rid of products that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to remove spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
