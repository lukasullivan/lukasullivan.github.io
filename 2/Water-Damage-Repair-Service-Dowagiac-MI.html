<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>If you're a cool freak, you've likely got all your natural cleaning solutions at the ready. You have your approach for cleaning a fabric face mask down pat.

Using bleach on these products will kill the mold above the surface area but the roots within the product will stay and the mold will soon return.</p>

Any mold requires removal, so please don't take any indications of mold lightly because there is either just a percentage noticeable or the color is not black. Enough concentration of any mold is damaging, specifically to younger children and to the elderly, due to the development of airborne mold spores.</p>
