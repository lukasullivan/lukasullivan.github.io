When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job appropriately.
