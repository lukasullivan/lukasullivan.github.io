<p>Drywall is really a panel of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched in between 2 kinds of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Gypsum Corporation put out an item called Sheetrock" suggested to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering. Because it increased quickly without the need for wood lathe, the product was billed as the pauper's answer to plaster walls" By the 1950s and 60s, drywall had actually ended up being a standard building and construction product.</p>

<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Ashland</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health danger and need to be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
