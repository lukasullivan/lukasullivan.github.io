<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most reliable. It is important to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and hidden energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure products and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the much faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
