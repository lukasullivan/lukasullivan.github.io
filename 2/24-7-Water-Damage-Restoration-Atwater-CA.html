<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
