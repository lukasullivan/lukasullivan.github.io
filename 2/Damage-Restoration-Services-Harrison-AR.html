<p>Mold enjoys to grow in your home's attic and crawl spaces, but what brought the mold in the first location? The short answer: darkness and the presence of wetness in the environment. Stone floors need less time to change than water damaged hardwood floorings. A complete floor replacement can be expected to be finished in 4 to 10 days. Water damaged walls often peel and may need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs several hours.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
