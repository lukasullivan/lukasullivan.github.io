<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth learning.
