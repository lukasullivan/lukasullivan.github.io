Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
