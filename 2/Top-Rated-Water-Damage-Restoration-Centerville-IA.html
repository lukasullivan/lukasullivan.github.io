<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Centerville</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists typically advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This might worsen the problem because as you understand - mold likes damp environments.<p>
