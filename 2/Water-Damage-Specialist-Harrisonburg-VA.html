<p>Since typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
