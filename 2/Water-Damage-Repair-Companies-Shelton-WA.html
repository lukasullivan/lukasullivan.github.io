<p>Inspect the drywall to see just how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Eliminate all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels only show water discolorations but aren't structurally jeopardized, they might be repairable by eliminating the damaged portion. When cutting out around the damaged location, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
