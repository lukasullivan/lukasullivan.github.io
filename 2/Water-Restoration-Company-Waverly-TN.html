These conditions can help in identifying what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and practical energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure materials and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation results.
