<p>Because the gypsum drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it damp can develop into a major headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply starts to droop before drying out, fixing it might just need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

Beneath seemingly unblemished exteriors made of different products-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged everything from window sills to insulation that once puffed like pink cotton candy.

<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health hazard and ought to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
