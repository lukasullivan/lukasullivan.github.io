<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floorings and walls is another possible impact of water damage. Walls and flooring may require replacement or refinishing depending on the extent of damage. Moldy odors can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the beginning point for lots of severe problems that can affect a building, damage personal property and present major health risks to residents. To bring back residential or commercial property and safeguard health, a professional restoration specialist should carefully manage the project. They should be well-informed in several disciplines, consisting of stopping bacteria from dispersing, avoiding mold development, avoiding secondary damage, and saving the structure and its many contents. In addition, they should be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurance company agents with confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the ideal breeding place for mold, while poor indoor ventilation can trigger molds to prosper. Wet building products and humid indoor air are mold's buddies.</p>

MMR helps Mold Solutions NW address stain concerns along with mold growth by getting under the surface on affected areas.</p>

Never scrape dried mold, otherwise the harmful spores could spread into air and cause negative health impacts.</p>
