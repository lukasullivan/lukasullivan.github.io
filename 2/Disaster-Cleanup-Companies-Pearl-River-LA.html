<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floors and walls is another prospective result of water damage. Walls and floor covering might need replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Moldy odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
