<p>You want to address bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
