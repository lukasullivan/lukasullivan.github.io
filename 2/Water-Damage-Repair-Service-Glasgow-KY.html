<p>Daily wetness readings must be included in the drying record to include devices, hvac, and air systems. Wetness content levels for wet structural products need to be tape-recorded in a moisture content spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These tape-recorded wetness material readings will reveal that the structure is back to an acceptable series of pre-loss condition. It is very important to know that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if adjustments are needed.</p>

<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach stability. Computing the dew point is important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid kind. The greater the humidity rises, the greater the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>Damaged locations larger than 12 square inches may require a total replacement panel installed since large pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For instance, if the area where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a spot by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might need to replace the whole drywall panel.</p>
