Did you understand that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be.
