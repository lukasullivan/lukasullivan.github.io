<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on floors and walls is another prospective effect of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage. Musty smells can stick around in a home where leaks or flooding have actually occurred and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
