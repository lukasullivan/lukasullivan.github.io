<p>One reason is that bleach can not totally kill mold growing in permeable products. The chlorine in bleach can not penetrate into porous surfaces such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface area of porous products and only the water component of the bleach is soaked up into the material, providing more wetness for the mold to eat. Last Repair works: The final steps of the fire damage restoration task are the conclusion of repair work. Generally, repairs consist of the replacement of materials, painting, and any other repair services that will be required to bring back the home or organisation to its pre-loss condition.<p>
