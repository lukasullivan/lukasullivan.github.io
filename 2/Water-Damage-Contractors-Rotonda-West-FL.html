Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually become infected with molds.
