Whether it's caused by heavy rain, overruning waterways, or damaged pipes, the water needs to be removed and the structure's contents need to be rapidly dried to avoid structural damage, mold growth, and other problems. When there is lots of wetness from a dripping roofing system, high humidity, or flood, the mold grows best. There is no chance to get rid of all molds and mold spores from your home. But you can control mold development by keeping your home dry.<p>

Most mold removal (remediation) takes anywhere from 1 day to 5 days. Water damaged carpeting and drywall will naturally dry.
