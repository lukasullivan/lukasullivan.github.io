<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

<p>Since typical building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
