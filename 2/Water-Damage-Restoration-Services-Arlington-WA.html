In order to get an even, finished look, it is essential to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
