<p>Unfavorable air makers, geared up with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air filters") should be made use of to remove germs and other pollutants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage need to be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with appropriate waste holding tanks which must be disposed of appropriately. Tough surfaces that are impacted need to be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural products such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard need to be removed and appropriately gotten rid of. Any material that soaks up substantial quantities of moisture and can not be sufficiently cleaned need to be eliminated. When contaminated products have been eliminated, a 2nd application of sanitizers must be applied to all work surface areas.</p>
