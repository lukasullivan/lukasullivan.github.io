This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really costly paperweight.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
