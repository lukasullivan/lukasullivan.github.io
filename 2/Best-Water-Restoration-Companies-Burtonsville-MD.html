<p>Any structure that has actually struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore protection, and cover hands, arms and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will lower the incidence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in most hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the musty areas, in addition to any adjacent areas. If you utilize bleach, ensure it will not stain the product or surface. Place all sponges, equipment and other products utilized in cleaning in a sturdy garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a neighboring exit instead of the main house, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>
