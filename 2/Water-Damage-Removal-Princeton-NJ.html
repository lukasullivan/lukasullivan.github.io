<p>Eliminating among the 3 requirements for mold decreases (or eliminates) brand-new mold growth: wetness; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and warmth considering that mold usually does not grow in cold environments.

I would absolutely recommend for any mitigation or restoration work you need.<p>
<p>Pump out flooded basements gradually (about one-third of the water per day) to prevent structural damage. If the water is pumped out completely in a brief period of time, pressure from water-saturated soil on the outside might cause basement walls to collapse.
