Many individuals believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>BRAVO - job well done! Discovered a flood in the house in San Francisco - water had been over streaming a second floor sink for 15 hours. Called Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of equipment to alleviate the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood ceilings, floors and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Exceptional, expert care. Very pleased with their speedy delivery of emergency service AND their attention to information to make sure the water damage was dried out entirely.</p>
<h3>Why You Should Hire Winnetka Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
