<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth discovering. As soon as the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
