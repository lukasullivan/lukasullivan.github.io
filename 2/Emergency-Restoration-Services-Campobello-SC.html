There is no reputable schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal components generally start wearing away immediately after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of an issue. How quick the deterioration process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all till you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
