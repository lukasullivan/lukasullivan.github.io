As an in your area owned and run company, SERVPRO of Black Hawk County is nearby and all set to help with your mold-damaged home. Please call us at the number on the top of the page for mold remediation and removal services, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

We supply emergency water restoration services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - consisting of all vacations. Seattle locals can anticipate an immediate response day, night or time.<p>
<p>The time it takes for the mold removal procedure depends upon numerous factors such as how much mold is present, where the mold is growing (behind walls, and so on), and the products it grows on. Most mold removal (remediation) takes anywhere from 1 day to 5 days. Water damaged carpeting and drywall will naturally dry. Further, actual time drying helps to instantly adjust fan speed, thaw cycles, and more to help speed up drying times in varying structures and conditions.<p>
<p>For this factor, we created a four-step method that permits us to clean the affected location without jeopardizing the rest of your home. We can help restore the environment in your house and provide permanent treatments that keep mold growth at bay. Set an old box fan or a low-cost brand-new one in a window to aerate the room while working. Toss it out when you're done cleaning, since the spores are practically impossible to clean off. Tape plywood or cardboard around the window openings so the spores can't blow back in<p>
<p>After scrubbing the surfaces, allow the bleach option to continue to penetrate the surface areas and dry. Getting an area dry requires eliminating the wetness not only from the affected materials but also from the air. Fans will blow air across the surface and cause the water to vaporize, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it will not kick back into the material and trigger more damage to the room.<p>
