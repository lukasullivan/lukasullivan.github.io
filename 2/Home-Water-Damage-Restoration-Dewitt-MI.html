<p>Mold and mildew are kinds of fungi that quickly reach emergency anywhere moisture is present inside. This can result from any number of scenarios such as flooding, water accumulation after a fire, a damaged pipe, or perhaps a malfunctioning HEATING AND COOLING system - all of which can result in difficulty. Any high degree of moisture, integrated with temperature level and nutrients, produces the ideal environment for the fungal components of mold and mildew to thrive. It is very important to eliminate the source of the moisture to avoid the spread of mold contamination as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each two to three spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of several days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
