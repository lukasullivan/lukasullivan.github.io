<h2>Having Insurance for Water Damage in Vermillion</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
