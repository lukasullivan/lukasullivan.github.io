<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a large brush, and remember that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be gotten rid of and replaced. If basement carpet has actually ended up being moldy, sweep it (while using a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or utilize high-powered fans to get rid of wetness if it's attached to the floor.</p>
