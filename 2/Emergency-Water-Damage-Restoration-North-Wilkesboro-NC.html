<p>Check the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Eliminate all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to remove it. They might be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion if drywall panels only show water spots but aren't structurally jeopardized. When eliminating around the damaged location, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
