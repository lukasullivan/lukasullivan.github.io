<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted stretching suburban homes, starter homes, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics built with materials aside from stucco had issues, too. Some homes with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Because tiny mold spores exist naturally practically everywhere, inside and outdoors, getting rid of all mold from a home or business is difficult. Many restoration services advertise mold removal" and even ensure to eliminate all mold. This is a misconception. We understand mold and mold development. SERVPRO of Lexington, KY has the training and expertise to remediate the mold in your home or company.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout numerous days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
