<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any circumstance, especially when the hot water heater unit lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater is imminent unless repaired quickly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The perpetrator might have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
