<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or tough and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find signs of moisture or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>It only takes a little water leak, or perhaps excess humidity, for mold to form in your Cedar Falls home or company. Then, mold can spread quickly through the property in as low as 48 hours. Mold can produce irritants and allergens, and it has the possible to trigger other health impacts. If your home or business has a mold issue, we can inspect and examine your home and use our specialized equipment, know-how, and training to remediate your mold problem.</p>
