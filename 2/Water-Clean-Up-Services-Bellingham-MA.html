Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season.
