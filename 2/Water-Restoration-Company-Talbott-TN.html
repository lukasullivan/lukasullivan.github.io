These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days.
