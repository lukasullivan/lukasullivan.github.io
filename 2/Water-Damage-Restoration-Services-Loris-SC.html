<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his men were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your home and began drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the way and also were extremely useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>

<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be an irreversible health danger and need to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
