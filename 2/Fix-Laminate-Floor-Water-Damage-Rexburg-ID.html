<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth learning. Once the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
