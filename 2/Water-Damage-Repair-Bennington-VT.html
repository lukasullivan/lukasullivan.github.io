<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth learning. Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
