<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Vidor</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears.
