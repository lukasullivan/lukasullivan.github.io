<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it may look cottony, velvety, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find indications of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
