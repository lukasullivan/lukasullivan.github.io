<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products take in water quickly.
