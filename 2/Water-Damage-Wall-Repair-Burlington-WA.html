By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is finished.<p>
