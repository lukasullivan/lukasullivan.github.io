<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Ridge</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repair work, remember that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
