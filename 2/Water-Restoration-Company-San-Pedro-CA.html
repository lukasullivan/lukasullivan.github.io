<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, throughout several days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
