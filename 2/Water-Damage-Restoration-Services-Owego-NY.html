Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.

<p>Flooding of a private sewage system can be a hazardous circumstance for homeowners, according to Pipes 2.0's seasoned plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It may result in a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and lack of sanitation up until the system is repaired.

<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Owego - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health danger and should be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
