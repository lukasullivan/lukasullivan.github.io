These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days.
