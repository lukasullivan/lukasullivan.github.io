<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is damp and good, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Unfavorable air devices, equipped with HEPA (high performance particulate air filters") need to be used to get rid of bacteria and other contaminants from the air throughout restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage must be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with proper waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of properly. Hard surfaces that are affected must be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard should be eliminated and effectively disposed of. Any material that soaks up substantial amounts of moisture and can not be adequately cleaned should be gotten rid of. As soon as contaminated products have actually been removed, a second application of sanitizers need to be applied to all work surface areas.</p>
