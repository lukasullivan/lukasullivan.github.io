Once MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working.

If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process.
