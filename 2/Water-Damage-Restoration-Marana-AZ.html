<p>Secure Non-Damaged Areas- As soon as containment barriers are established we will start getting rid of the wet dry wall and begin to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry. We will also move furnishings out of the damp areas to guarantee that all excess moisture inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold problems emerge later.<p>
