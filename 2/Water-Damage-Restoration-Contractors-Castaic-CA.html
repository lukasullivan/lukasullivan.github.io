<p>Any structure that has actually experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore protection, and cover hands, legs and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the musty location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will lower the occurrence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the moldy areas, in addition to any nearby areas. If you use bleach, make certain it won't tarnish the material or surface.
