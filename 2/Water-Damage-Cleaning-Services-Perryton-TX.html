<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly destructive. When InstaScope was produced, we engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air contamination, this team was designated to validate and check the new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to create a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can provide scientifically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the threats of mold, InstaScope is an important tool to assist make sure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>

Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical sensitivities especially if used in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at getting rid of mold than a moist fabric and a moderate cleaning agent, so we suggest the least hazardous option.</p>
<p>A final assessment helps discover any possible location where mold may still prowl. Surface areas with contamination and mold are eliminated and ruined and the workspace is tidied up.
