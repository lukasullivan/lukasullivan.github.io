<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

Water intrusion that includes a considerable quantity of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying might need special techniques, longer drying times, or considerable water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
