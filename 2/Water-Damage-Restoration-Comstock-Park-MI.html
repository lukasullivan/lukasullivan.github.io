<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
