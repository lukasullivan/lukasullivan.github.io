<p>HEATING AND COOLING: Heater and air conditioning system units can become flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot lights. They can likewise end up being muddy, and cleaning them will require professional cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and become infected.

<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Pataskala</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and should be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
