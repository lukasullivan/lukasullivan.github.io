<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Black mold can be hazardous to your health, mainly causing respiratory concerns. But in extreme cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can cause pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you might wish to buy a mold testing set to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and call in a professional to aid with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you likely currently have on-hand) that will help eliminate mold.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache due to the fact that the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to sag before drying out, repairing it may just require pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Through both rain and snow throughout the year, Seattle residents have actually seen their fair share of the almost 40 inches expected annually.
