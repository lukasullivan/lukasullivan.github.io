<p>The area that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can quickly travel when they are disrupted. Air filtering systems are generally used in combination with the sealing of the location to get rid of as many air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the location includes using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative atmospheric pressure, which prevents the blood circulation of air between the infected area and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be shut off to prevent the mold from spreading too.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications.</p>
