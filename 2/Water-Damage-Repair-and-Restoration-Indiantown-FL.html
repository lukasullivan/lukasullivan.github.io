<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted sprawling suburban homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
