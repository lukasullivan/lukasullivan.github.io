<p>Depending upon the amount of water present and the period of saturation, you may have the ability to repair the water damage. Heavily saturated drywall will droop or collapse to the touch and need to be completely changed. If the drywall is still firmly fastened to studs and the water damaged area is small, you might have the ability to remove a little part of the wall and spot it. Significant storms and flooding events can overwhelm many restoration companies. On the other hand, SERVPRO of N. Okaloosa, Walton, Holmes & Washington Counties can access resources from 1,700 Franchises throughout the state and country and even use Disaster Recovery Teams for significant storms and catastrophes.<p>
<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always practical. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth discovering. Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
<p>Utilize a sharp energy knife to cut at the line. Get rid of baseboard trim and after that get rid of wet drywall. You might also need to get rid of wet insulation.

Our extensive range of restoration options will bring an industry-leading standard of fast response time and top-level experience in water damage remediation.<p>
