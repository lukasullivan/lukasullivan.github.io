<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health danger and should be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
