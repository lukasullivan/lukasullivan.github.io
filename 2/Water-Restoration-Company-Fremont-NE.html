For items that can be brought back, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into porous surface area, preventing water from seeping back through. Essentially, it makes the area strong once again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
