Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & discovered of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
