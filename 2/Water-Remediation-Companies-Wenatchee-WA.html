Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
