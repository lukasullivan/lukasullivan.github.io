Did you understand that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
