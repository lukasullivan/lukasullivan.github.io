<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work.

Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is ended up, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
<p>To kill mold: Use white distilled vinegar and put it into a spray bottle without watering it down. Spray the vinegar onto the musty surface and leave it to sit for an hour.

Fischer advises that you evaluate your specific policy, and reach out to your insurance provider as early as possible while doing so so you can get the best assistance on whether and when to submit an actual claim.<p>
