<h3>Basement Flood Cleanup Services in Goodlettsville Tennessee</h2>
<p>We recently had significant water damage due to a washing maker overflow. Rainbow came out to your home on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and proceeded to take the action required to prevent more damage burning the midnight oil into the night. They also completed the entire dry which took numerous days and a lot of hard work. Always shown up on time and did what they assured and kept me notified of each action. It was a pleasure to handle the whole group. I would not hesitate to recommend them for any work of this nature including mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>Because mold and mildew can be a severe health danger, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate as much as 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going person.</p>
