<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
