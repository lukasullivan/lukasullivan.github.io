<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is moist and great, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days.
