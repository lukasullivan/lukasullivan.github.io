<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As discussed, rapid air motion throughout wet surface areas of products or assemblies is an important element of effectively and effectively drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air motion throughout the surface of material ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area wetness paves the way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials require various criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>After a residential or industrial water emergency - such as a flooded basement, sewer backup, or perhaps damage from winter storms and ice dams - every second that ticks produces more damage to your home or business.

<p>Because mold and mildew can be a serious health hazard, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
