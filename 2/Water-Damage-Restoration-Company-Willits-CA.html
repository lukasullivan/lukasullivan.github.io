<p>Flooding can trigger serious damage to a business building. Whether it's brought on by heavy rain, overflowing waterways, or damaged pipes, the water needs to be gotten rid of and the structure's contents should be rapidly dried to prevent structural damage, mold growth, and other problems.

However you can manage mold development by keeping your home dry.<p>
