<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As mentioned, rapid air motion across wet surfaces of assemblies or materials is a crucial component of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air movement across the surface area of product ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface moisture paves the way to reducing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying products require different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
