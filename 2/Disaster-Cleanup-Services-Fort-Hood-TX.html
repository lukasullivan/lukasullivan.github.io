<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a severe health threat. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>If your restroom or kitchen area has suffered substantial water damage after a major leak, it may be a good time to remodel and update rather than hiring multiple contractors to do the repair.

Contact a restroom remodeling professional for recommendations and quotes.</p>
<h3>Why You Should Hire Fort Hood Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
