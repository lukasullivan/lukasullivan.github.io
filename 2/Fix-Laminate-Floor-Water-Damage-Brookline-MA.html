<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or service is among the most terrible things that can occur to a household or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired instead of being completely replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might need repairing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might need replacing and sometimes even the subfloor too. The type of wood flooring you may have figures out and limits the type of repairs that need to take place. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a broader range of options to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for private slabs. The very best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
