When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done correctly.
