<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.
