<h2>Emergency Water Damage Cleanup in Inver Grove Heights - Here's What You Need To Know In</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Water damage develops from broken pipelines, blocked drains pipes, malfunctioning appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The suitable treatment depends on the nature of the damage. Some water brings contaminants and need to be considered harmful. Whatever the origin, the potential customers for restoration depend largely on the speed with which your structure and personal effects can be dried. Even clean water can generate mildew and other bacterial growth if neglected.</p>
<h3>Mold Cleanup Companies in Inver Grove Heights Minnesota</h2>
<p>Regrettably, nevertheless, using bleach is just effective if the mold is growing on non-porous materials such as tiles, bathtubs, glass and countertops. Bleach can not permeate into permeable products and so it does not come into contact with mold growing below the surface of materials such as wood and drywall. Utilizing bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface area however the roots within the product will stay and the mold will soon return.</p>
