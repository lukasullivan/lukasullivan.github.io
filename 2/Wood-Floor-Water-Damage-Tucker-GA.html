<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any adjustments if you have concerns on this.</p>
